# Health and Fitness Tracking System

## Overview

This repository contains the backend database for a Health and Fitness Tracking System developed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Python. The system is designed to help users track and manage their fitness journey by organizing key data such as workout routines, nutrition, health goals, and progress over time.

## Features

* **User Profiles:** Stores and manages user information.
* **Exercise Logs:** Records details of workouts performed.
* **Nutrition Tracking:** Allows users to log their food intake.
* **Goal Setting:** Enables users to set and track fitness goals.
* **Progress Monitoring:** Provides tools to view and analyze progress over time.
* **Efficient Data Handling:** Utilizes SQL features like stored procedures, views, triggers, and aggregate functions.
* **Backend Focus:** Primarily a database solution, designed for integration with future user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* SQL (including stored procedures, views, triggers, aggregate functions)

## Getting Started

1.  **Database Setup:**
    * Ensure you have Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed.
    * The SQL scripts to create the database and tables are included in this repository (`DBMSPROJQUERIESDATABASE.sql`).
    * Run the script in SSMS to set up the database.

2.  **Python Backend:**
    * The Python code for interacting with the database is included in this repository (`Health_and_Fitness_Tracking_System.py` and `prac.py`).
    * *(You can add instructions on how to run the Python code here once you have them)*

## Future Enhancements

* Development of a user-friendly graphical interface.
* Integration with wearable fitness trackers.
* Advanced data analysis and reporting features.
